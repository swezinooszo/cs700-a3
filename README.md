# About The Project

The program aims to measure the time required for sorting arrays in different orders and sizes. It employs sorting orders including random, ascending, and reverse, focusing primarily on three array sizes: Hundred Thousand, One Million, and Ten Million. The program presents a figure illustrating the execution time per array size, where ten arrays undergo sorting in three different orders for each array size. Execution times are measured in microseconds.

# Build With
The c++ program is built using Visual Studio Code on MacOS.
